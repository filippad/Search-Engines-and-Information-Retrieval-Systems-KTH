-------------- Task 1.5 ---------------

## Label the documents

1 data/davisWiki/Elaine_Kasimatis.f 3 - It is about a mathematics program graduate.
1 data/davisWiki/Events_Calendars.f 0 - Only urls.
1 data/davisWiki/Student_Organizations.f 1 - Points to graduation topic but no further information.
1 data/davisWiki/Quantitative_Biology_and_Bioinformatics.f 2 - Related to program graduate and mathematics (bio-mathematics)
1 data/davisWiki/Private_Tutoring.f 3 - Provide information needed if one wants to hire a private tutor in order to graduate a program in maths
1 data/davisWiki/Economics.f 1 - It does point to economics which is an application of maths but does not really related to the topic of graduation in maths
1 data/davisWiki/Biological_Systems_Engineering.f 1 - Simliar to the above but biology instead of economics
1 data/davisWiki/UC_Davis_English_Department.f 0 - Mathematics is mentioned but it is about experiences of students who has studied in this apartment which does not relate to maths.
1 data/davisWiki/Computer_Science.f 1 - It does point to computer science which is an application of maths but does not really related to the topic of graduation in maths
1 data/davisWiki/What_I_Wish_I_Knew...Before_Coming_to_UC_Davis_Entomology.f 2 - Even though it does not discuss much about maths but a lot about the topic of graduating program
1 data/davisWiki/Evelyn_Silvia.f 1 - About a person who graduated mathematics
1 data/davisWiki/Fiber_and_Polymer_Science.f 1 -

## Precision: the fraction of retrieved documents that are relevant

precision = good/retrieved = (relevant and retrieved) / retrieved = 16/22 = 0.7273


## Recall: the fraction of relevant documents that are retrieved

recall = good / relevant = (relevant and retrieved) / relevant = 16/100 = 0.16

-------------- Task 3.3 ---------------

!!! Remember to uncomment printing for "ve" and "th he" in Engine

-------------- Task 3.4 ---------------

## How would you interpret the meaning of the query "historic* humo*r"?

Find all docs containing any word beginning “historic”, and any word beginning with “humo”
ending in “r”

## Why could the word "revenge" be returned by a bigram index in return to a query "re*ve"?

Although it does not end in "ve" but it contains both kGrams "re" and "ve". Intersection
does not take care of what the word has to end with.

## How could this problem of false positives be solved?
